uptimer
======

Simle module to get uptime of app and system.

Internally uses process.uptime() for app uptime and /proc/uptime for system uptime.

Usage:
```js
var uptimer = require('uptimer')

var systemUptime = uptimer.getSystemUptime();
var appUptime = uptimer.getAppUptime();
```

This is a sync package, so I don't think it can be useful in production (internally fs.readFileSync).

I did it for my own needs: [laptop.marinintim.com](http://laptop.marinintim.com)
